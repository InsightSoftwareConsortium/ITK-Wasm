*itk-wasm* combines [ITK](https://www.itk.org/) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to enable high-performance spatial analysis in a web browser, Node.js, and reproducible execution across programming languages and hardware architectures.

The project provides tools to a) build C/C++ code to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), b) bridge local filesystems, JavaScript/Typescript data structures, and traditional file formats, c) transfer data efficiently in and out of the WebAssembly runtime, and d) asynchronous, parallel execution of processing pipelines in a worker pool.  *itk-wasm* can be used to execute [ITK](https://www.itk.org/) or arbitrary C++ codes in the browser, on a workstation / server with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), or standalone execution and wrapped in [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) runtimes.

## Installation

```
npm install itk-wasm
```

## Usage
