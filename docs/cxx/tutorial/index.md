# Tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through the process of *creating WebAssembly scientific C++ processing pipelines*, and the steps address the following topics:

1. Build system setup and installation.
2. Create a simple C++ processing pipeline.
3. Execute a wasm pipeline on the command line.
4. Execute a wasm pipeline on the command line via Node.js.
5. Execute a wasm pipeline in the browser.
6. Handle non-trivial data types a the wasm pipeline interface.
7. Debug a wasm pipeline.

This [Jupyter notebook
tutorial](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ScientificImageAnalysisVisualizationAndArtificialIntelligenceCourse/blob/master/10_Create_Scientific_WebAssembly_Pipelines.ipynb) also provides an interactive walkthrough.
