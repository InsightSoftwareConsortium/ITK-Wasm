# ITK-Wasm in a browser application via Webpack

This example demonstrates how to use *itk-wasm* in a web browser application built with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Find the full example in the `itk-wasm/examples/Webpack` [directory of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK-Wasm/tree/main/examples/Webpack).

Since we asynchronously download the *itk-wasm* JavaScript and WebAssembly Emscripten modules, a few extra configuration steps are required.

This example assumes you are creating a [Node.js package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm). If you do not already have a `package.json` file, [create one](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json), first.

Add `itk-wasm` and the io-packages to your project's dependencies:

```shell
npm install --save itk-wasm itk-image-io itk-mesh-io
```

Then, install Webpack-related development dependencies:

```shell
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server worker-loader babel-loader '@babel/preset-env' '@babel/core' copy-webpack-plugin
```

Next, create a `webpack.config.js` file like the following:

```javascript
const path = require('path')

const webpack = require('webpack')
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')

const entry = path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'index.js')
const outputPath = path.join(__dirname, './dist')
const itkConfig = path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'itkConfig.js')

module.exports = {
  entry,
  output: {
    path: outputPath,
    filename: 'index.js',
    library: {
      type: 'umd',
      name: 'bundle',
    },
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.js$/, loader: 'babel-loader' }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new CopyPlugin({
      patterns: [
        {
          from: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'itk-wasm', 'dist', 'web-workers'),
          to: path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'itk', 'web-workers')
        },
        {
          from: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'itk-image-io'),
          to: path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'itk', 'image-io')
        },
        {
          from: path.join(__dirname, 'node_modules', 'itk-mesh-io'),
          to: path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'itk', 'mesh-io')
        }
    ]})
  ],
  resolve: {
    fallback: { fs: false, path: false, url: false, module: false },
    alias: {
      '../itkConfig.js': itkConfig,
      '../../itkConfig.js': itkConfig,
    },
  },
  performance: {
    maxAssetSize: 10000000
  }
}
```

Replace `src/index.js` by your [Webpack entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry). Replace `./dist/` and the output filename with where you [want Webpack to place the generated JavaScript bundle](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#output).


The [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) rule will [transpile](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them) JavaScript from the latest language syntax to a syntax supported by existing browser clients. Configure the target browsers to support with a `.babelrc` file like the following:

```javascript
{
  presets: [
    ['@babel/preset-env', {
      targets: {
        browsers: ['last 2 versions'],
      },
    }],
  ],
}
```

The *itk-wasm* Emscripten modules are loaded and executed **asynchronously** and **on demand**. This means the client only download the content it needs and the user does not experience interruption of the main user interface thread during computation. However, a few extra configuration steps are required since the modules are not bundled by Webpack.

The `CopyPlugin` copies *itk-wasm* Emscripten modules to distribute along with your Webpack bundle. In this example, we copy all *image-io*, and *mesh-io*. In your project, you may want to copy only the *image-io* or a subset of the *image-io*, based on your needs. We also copy the *web-workers*, which asynchronously perform IO or run processing pipelines in a background thread.

To change the location of the *itk-wasm* web worker and Emscripten modules, set the Webpack `resolve.alias` setting for an `itkConfig.js` module so the bundle will use our included web worker and io WebAssembly modules. The `src/itkConfig.js` for this example is:

```javascript
const itkConfig = {
  pipelineWorkerUrl: '/itk/web-workers/min-bundles/pipeline.worker.js',
  imageIOUrl: '/itk/image-io',
  meshIOUrl: '/itk/mesh-io',
  pipelinesUrl: '/itk/pipelines',
}

export default itkConfig
```

Define commands to build the project or build the project and start a local development web server in the *scripts* section of the `package.json` file,

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "build": "webpack --progress --colors -p",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --content-base ./dist/ --watch-content-base"
  },
```

Build the project with

```shell
npm run build
```

To start the development web server, run

```shell
npm run start
```

## Testing with Cypress

This section described how to configure browser-based testing with the [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

First, install Cypress and the `start-server-and-test` package.

```shell
npm install --save-dev cypress start-server-and-test
```

The `start-server-and-test` tool can start our development server for testing with Cypress.

Create directories to house our tests and test data:

```shell
mkdir -p cypress/integration cypress/fixtures
```

Provide a test dataset:

```shell
cp /path/to/cow.vtk cypress/fixtures/cow.vtk
```

Create our test script at *cypress/integration/load_data_spec.js*. The test files names should end in **_spec.js*.

```javascript
describe('Load data', () => {
  it('successfully loads a mesh', () => {
    cy.visit('http://localhost:8080/')
    cy.fixture('cow.vtk', null).then((cowBuffer) => {
      cy.get('input[type=file]').selectFile({ contents: cowBuffer, fileName: 'cow.vtk' })
      cy.get('textarea').contains('"numberOfPoints": 2903,')
    })
  })
})
```

Then, specify npm scripts to develop and debug the tests and run them in an automated way.

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --static ./dist/",
    "cypress:open": "pnpm exec cypress open",
    "cypress:run": "pnpm exec cypress run",
    "test:debug": "start-server-and-test start http-get://localhost:8080 cypress:open",
    "test": "start-server-and-test start http-get://localhost:8080 cypress:run"
  },
```

Note that [with webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test#note-for-webpack-dev-server-users) we need to use `http-get` with `start-server-and-test`.

To develop or debug tests, run

```shell
npm run test:debug
```

This will open Cypress. Select the test to run:


![Select load_data_spec](../../static/umd/umd_select_load_data_spec.png)

This will load the selected browser to see the test status and web page that is tested.  You can also open the browser's development console.

![Develop and debug tests](../../static/umd/umd_test_debug.png)

To run the tests during continuous integration:

```shell
npm run test
```

This will output the tests results in the console:

![Console test output](../../static/umd/umd_run_tests.png)

And produce a video of the result at *cypress/videos/*.
