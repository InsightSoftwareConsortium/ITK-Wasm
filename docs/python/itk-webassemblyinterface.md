# itk-webassemblyinterface

This Python package provides native binary interfaces to the [ITK-Wasm file formats](https://wasm.itk.org/en/latest/introduction/file_formats/index.html) that can be used with `itk.imread`, `itk.meshread`, `itk.transformread`, `itk.imwrite`, etc.

For execution of [ITK-Wasm](https://wasm.itk.org) WASI binaries, which contain support for the ITK-Wasm file formats and other file formats, see the `itkwasm-image-io`, `itkwasm-mesh-io`, and `itkwasm-transform-io` packages.
